# Thank you for providing us with this information. 
When you are added as a member of the GO GitHub project, you automatically follow a number of repositories (different ones, depending on your role). By default, emails will be sent for all new and updated tickets. You can reduce this by going to the individual repo, and clicking on the 'eye' icon at the top right of the screen. We strongly recommend:

    Not watching: Be notified only when participating (ie when you comment on a ticket or manually watch it) or @mentioned. This is the optimal option to get relevant information. 


Please disregard the checklist below.  We will perform these internal tasks using the information provided above as soon as we can.
