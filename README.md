The GO Helpdesk
===============

Welcome to the [Gene Ontology](http://geneontology.org) Helpdesk.

For questions, you should first check our [Frequently Asked Questions](http://geneontology.org/faq-page), as your query may have already been answered.

If you are having trouble using or connecting to any of our public services, you may wish to check our [status page](http://status.geneontology.org/).

The GOC also supports several [mailing lists](http://www.geneontology.org/page/go-mailing-lists) to foster discussion within the GO community. Subscribe to one or more of these mailing lists to follow general developments, discussions within the GOC, or to post a message to the GO community.

Otherwise, if you have a question about the GO, its data, usage, software, or services, please login, [create a ticket](https://github.com/geneontology/helpdesk/issues), and join the community on GitHub!
